My account had sufficient funds to not only cover the amount but also the fee of {$7.00}. After speaking with XXXX or XXXX a payment of {$100.00} was successfully processed. I do not wish to receive further calls stating my payment was declined due to Insufficient funds and was able to speak with the apartment manager XXXX or XXXX regarding the issue of the phone call and my concern for my future payments. She did offer assistance in processing future payments via a Money Order and honoring the current balance of {$790.00}. I find not only a concern that the assigned Account XXXX sped through the last phone call I had with her, but also a concern that when attempting to resolve this matter with a Supervisor, I was transferred multiple times only to receive a busy signal. I also find it discomforting that during a LiveChat session with XXXX XXXX required my full Social Security Number to simply tell me that they can not send me any proof until I have paid the account in full. It is disturbing the lack of customer service debt collectors have.

( SEE PAGE 19 OF ITEM # 1 ) On XXXX I sent ProCollect a standard dispute letter and asked them to provide evidence of the debt 's validity. I later received a statement dated XXXX that showed a balance of {$1900.00} and included an incomplete breakdown of some accounting that indicated a balance of {$2200.00}. The {$2200.00} included a final line item charge of {$1900.00} with no clear information about what the {$1900.00} charge was for. There was also included a partial lease agreement that was missing sections or pages. ( SEE ITEM # 2 IS EVERYTHING THEY SENT ) On XXXX I mailed them a second dispute letter outlining all the issues I found with their attempted validation. ( SEE ITEM # 3 ATTACHED ) Also, on XXXX I pulled the reports again and saw all of the balances were still reporting {$3400.00} and ProCollect had not marked the item as disputed with any of the bureaus even though they had completed their investigation and sent me their validation documents. ( SEE ITEM # 4 SEE PAGE 14 )  Them not reporting after completing their investigation to update the account is a violation of the FCRA. Finally, as of this week, the account is still reporting with multiple discrepancies with amounts, dates, etc. ( SEE ITEM # 5 PAGE 18 ) In summary, my arguments are they knowingly reported a balance due that was nearly double the amount they had showing in their system. I feel this was a deliberate attempt to extort extra money from me. When asked to validate the debt they could only produce documentation for about {$1900.00} on one item and about {$2200.00} on another obviously far less than they were demanding. Secondly, they completed their investigation in approximately 2 weeks and mailed me documentation confirming it, but they did not report to the bureaus to update the account after their investigation was completed.

The place was filthy disgusting and consistently was being bought out by a new management company every few months. They also had buildings with condemned apartments in them and almost were shut down due to how disgusting they are. \n\nA few months before our lease ended, our kitchen started to leak water from somewhere. We did n't know if it was dishwasher, sink what it was but it got to the point that we had about XXXX-XXXX inches of standing water in our kitchen. We made numerous phone calls to the office asking for someone to come take care of it and they refused. We let them know that if they did not take care of it we would not pay rent until they did. So we lived there for 2 months without paying rent and the problem never being fixed. Our apartment continuing to leak water all over the kitchen every time we cleaned it up again. When we moved out, we went to the office to hand in our keys and let them know that we did not clean up all the towels and stuff we had on the floor due to the water damage because it was not our fault and we were disgusted. We also let them know that the rent would not be paid for that because part of our lease states they were to respond to maintenance requests and they never did so since they did n't hold up their end of the lease agreement, we would not pay. We lived with a flooded kitchen and disgusting smell of molded wet towels barely even able to cook or pack up in our kitchen. I gave them the address to our new apartment for my security deposit and such and left. \n\n1 year later I go to apply to a new complex with my boyfriend and I find that I am declined. When I ask why they state it was because I owe money to XXXX XXXX and that it 's on my credit report. This comes as a shock to me as I had moved out of that apartment over a year ago and have never received a phone call, letter, invoice nothing stating that I owed any money to them. I knew that I had refused to pay rent for 2 months but since they never sent anything to me asking for payment nor contacted me about it on the phone, I assumed they let it go as they were wrong by not making my apartment XXXX livable and I could take them to court over it. So I contacted them after looking at my credit report and seeing that on XX/XX/XXXX they placed me with a collections agency regarding my past due money. When I contacted them I asked what besides my rent they were trying to claim I owed them, as my rent was not enough to equate to {$1100.00} at all. They claimed I owed for some damages, repainting and re-carpeting and such as well because they had no record of anyone 's move in sheets that were filled out 3 years prior since they company had been bought out by so many different new management companies during that time. They also could not provide me with a written statement or invoice for a breakdown of the charges they told me just to come in and write a check. At this point it was also yet another company that owned them than what it was when I moved out. I expressed that I wanted a manager to call me back immediately to dispute this because it was absolutely obscene and I never received a phone call. To this day, I still have not received a phone call, written notice or invoice. Somehow they also could not explain why I never received a security deposit back or why that did not pay towards the balance. And I also now see that the complex themselves not only has YET ANOTHER new management company but they have an entirely new name for the apartments. I do not know who to contact to get this account off my credit report as a negative mark. I do n't know if I have to take them to small claims to dispute it and show them pictures of the disgusting hallways and apartments and condemned buildings with broken locks and all this information.", "submitted_via": "Web", "issue": "Disclosure verification of debt", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "zip_code": "490XX"}, "_index": "complaint-public-v2"},{"_score": 0.0, "_type": "complaint", "_id": "3041733", "_source": {"company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "timely": "Yes", "product": "Debt collection", "sub_issue": "Didn't receive notice of right to dispute", "tags": null, "sub_product": "I do not know", "company": "ProCollect, Inc", "date_sent_to_company": "2018-10-21T12:00:00-05:00", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "date_received": "2018-10-10T12:00:00-05:00", "complaint_id": "3041733", "state": "TX", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent not provided", "complaint_what_happened": null, "submitted_via": "Web", "issue": "Written notification about debt", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "zip_code": "761XX"}, "_index": "complaint-public-v2"},{"_score": 0.0, "_type": "complaint", "_id": "408087", "_source": {"company_public_response": null, "timely": "No", "product": "Credit reporting", "sub_issue": "Account status", "tags": null, "sub_product": null, "company": "ProCollect, Inc", "date_sent_to_company": "2013-07-24T12:00:00-05:00", "consumer_disputed": "No", "date_received": "2013-05-15T12:00:00-05:00", "complaint_id": "408087", "state": "TX", "consumer_consent_provided": "N/A", "complaint_what_happened": null, "submitted_via": "Postal mail", "issue": "Incorrect information on credit report", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "zip_code": "751XX"}, "_index": "complaint-public-v2"},{"_score": 0.0, "_type": "complaint", "_id": "2933204", "_source": {"company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "timely": "Yes", "product": "Debt collection", "sub_issue": "Debt is not yours", "tags": null, "sub_product": "Other debt", "company": "ProCollect, Inc", "date_sent_to_company": "2018-06-13T12:00:00-05:00", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "date_received": "2018-06-12T12:00:00-05:00", "complaint_id": "2933204", "state": null, "consumer_consent_provided": "N/A", "complaint_what_happened": null, "submitted_via": "Phone", "issue": "Attempts to collect debt not owed", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "zip_code": null}, "_index": "complaint-public-v2"},{"_score": 0.0, "_type": "complaint", "_id": "2273051", "_source": {"company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "timely": "Yes", "product": "Debt collection", "sub_issue": "Frequent or repeated calls", "tags": "Servicemember", "sub_product": "Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)", "company": "ProCollect, Inc", "date_sent_to_company": "2017-01-03T12:00:00-05:00", "consumer_disputed": "No", "date_received": "2017-01-03T12:00:00-05:00", "complaint_id": "2273051", "state": "AL", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "complaint_what_happened": "I have received phone calls daily from all hours of the day on my cell phone, and then my house phone, and then my mothers cell phone.

Secondly, this printout was NOT a billing statement from the creditor that shows a detailed breakdown of the services rendered nor did it show a breakdown of fees or how they came to the amount they say I owe.

She never returned my call. I thought everything was fine. When I finally heard something about this incidence, I got a letter from Municipal Court that was forwarded to my new address. By that time, the court date, and the appeal process had passed. \nThis begs more questions than answers. I called XXXX again to let her know that I have been gone from there for a while. She stated, they couldnt locate the key. I refreshed her memory regarding our conversation. She told me to hold on. When she came back to the phone after ten minutes or so, she said she found the keys and apologized. I asked her about the court situation. \nShe told me not to worry and she would take care of it. I should have worried after looking back in regretful reflection. I got sued for {$2000.00} in court for KEYS I returned. I dont owe any money to XXXX.

The chutzpah of you maam to labor me as such, and corrupted my credit file where I can not get my V.A. loan. \nEvidently, this is an illegal sham with malicious forethought, or XXXX has some very bad bookkeeping problems. Either one leads me to believe that your collection company and XXXX are practicing a sense of criminality mixed with malevolent and foul intentions. However, these are the trickery and the foolery a leasing office plays with tenants. \nEspecially, when they have the backing of a ruthless collection company that has frightening intentions to degrade and besmirched an innocent Veteran/Gold Star Family Member under the faade of fair collection practices. \nMaam, you are more than uninformed, you are twisting the law as it stands. This makes you extremely dangerous! The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) governs the behavior of debt collectors and debt collection agencies. It places limits on what you can do, or can not do in collecting a no owe debt from me. Unfortunately, despite the law, Pro Collect Inc. are still engrossed in these illegal collection tactics. \nI called your business, I carefully explained the whole situation to your employee, and she said, you people never do right. You people? This phrase has long been used as an interpersonal generalization toward one culture. It has become known as a XXXX sobriquet that targeted African-Americans only. \nThis XXXX has manifested itself in terms of individual behavior at Pro Collect Inc., and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX through hate with institutional behavior. This racism is propagated and publicized under the expert tutelage of XXXX XXXX & CEO XXXX XXXX, the overseers at Pro Collect Inc. This is a classic move of evil. However, one characteristic of evil, it contains a seed of its own destruction. \nI decided to bring this tragedy of injustice up this week for a reason. This week we are celebrating XXXX XXXX XXXX birthday, and this is coinciding with the boycott my uncle is planning against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Georgia. Furthermore, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. \nI thank XXXX and give Him the praises by allowing my uncle to be a lifelong member, and a vice-president of the N.A.C.C.P. I am letting you know XXXX XXXX & CEO XXXX XXXX. We have reached out to XXXX XXXX with XXXX, Petition Online, XXXX. We will live stream the boycott through XXXX, and XXXX. I will let the world know Pro Collect Inc. had two years to right this wrong, or square this circle, and you stubbornly didnt, and you stubbornly wont. \nI will leave you with a quote from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity ( XXXX, XXXX ). It is XXXX and the ghost of XXXX XXXX is alive and well.", "submitted_via": "Web", "issue": "Attempts to collect debt not owed", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "zip_code": "31208"}, "_index": "complaint-public-v2"},{"_score": 0.0, "_type": "complaint", "_id": "1730633", "_source": {"company_public_response": "Company chooses not to provide a public response", "timely": "Yes", "product": "Debt collection", "sub_issue": "Not disclosed as an attempt to collect", "tags": null, "sub_product": "Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)", "company": "ProCollect, Inc", "date_sent_to_company": "2016-01-12T12:00:00-05:00", "consumer_disputed": "Yes", "date_received": "2016-01-07T12:00:00-05:00", "complaint_id": "1730633", "state": "MD", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "complaint_what_happened": "In XXXX 2015 we left our apartment in XXXX as our lease has ended. Before our last day the property management requested for a new mailing address in case they needed to contact us so I provided our new home/mailing address in XXXX, MD. Months have passed and I received a refund check from the apartment amounting to {$20.00}. In XXXX 2015, my nephew, who was also on the lease, found out that there was a derogatory report from XXXX XXXX amounting to over {$500.00}, I checked my credit report and I had it too, my friend, who was on the lease, had it too. We found out that it was from XXXX XXXX Apartment. I immediately contacted the apartment to inquire about this debt and asked them why would I receive a refund if we owe money to them. They could n't give me a clear answer and i was told that they would just notify us after they found out what was going on. We waited for 2 weeks and we didnt hear from them. On XXXX XXXX i contacted them again to follow up. They told me that we owe money for cleaning fee, unpaid untility bills etc. But i asked them why they never informed us regarding this debt, their answer was they sent the statement in XXXX but never heard from us. I told them that I never received anything and I wanted to see their mailing receipt but according to them they sent it via regular USPS mail so there was no receipt. I asked them again why they did n't try to contact me via email or phone before sending it to collection but they didnt say anything. It looks like they didnt exert effort to reach any of us before deciding to turn the debt over to the collection ruining our credit. \nWe never received any letter from the collection company too! The property manager sent me an email telling me that they will contact the collection to hold the debt and remove it from our credit for 30 days and we have to pay the debt within that period of time or the adverse report will be back on our credit. We are not running away from the unpaid bills ( if any ), our main concern is the derogatory report that they made and prevented us from making loans, apply for credit cards, etc. for 5 months without our knowledge.

I have been requesting this information since XX/XX/XXXX. I have only received offers to pay 50 %. \n3. Procollect Inc. will not accept evidence I have presented as they have verified that the evidence I have provided is accurate and correct. I was told that contacting the original creditor would not make any difference but they would investigate and have found this to be true. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I was granted permission per XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX for a termination of my lease based of security and hazardous living conditions. I was at an age I was not familiar with receiving a XXXX balanced lease ( as Procollect has requested ) to ensure this would have happened. However, I was granted permission to remove myself from their property due to first a sewer issue that caused XXXX to flood all pipe lines and the floor of the apartment. I begged to leave the permission from the time I moved in because all the issues that were occurring. After the last incident ( police report included ) upon moving in I was told that this complex had a camera system and ensured the safety of their residence, however, this was untrue and someone damaged my vehicle in front of a camera in use sign. The safety and security of their residence was being falsely advertised and I was only a college student that didnt expect to move into such a horrible place. The police and Health department was involved and on XX/XX/XXXX I was granted permission to leave and a report was filed on the damages of my car. I never knew that this account was sent to collections and this has been affecting me build my credit because this is inaccurate. \nProcollect Inc. has stated that I am being charged XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX which is for an additional month of rent and some key change fees but I had to submit the keys by XX/XX/XXXX and why charge for a key change if the keys were submitted. Once keys are submitted no fees should be added. The rent was {$550.00} a month and I am being charged {$640.00} as this does not make any since. \nI have spoken with XXXX, XXXX and a XXXX XXXX in regards to this account at Procollect I have provided all evidence and the evidence provided has not been accepted. I was told that I refused payment, I had 3 days until payment, didnt care about my safety or security in regards to this matter, my evidence was not enough and they wouldnt take any evidence that I had although verified by the original account owner and last but not least that they have provided different stories based on the evidence that I present and i do not believe this is fair. \nAlthough Procollect Inc and I have had some issues in the past with resolving this debt, and I was treated horribly, this debt is inaccurate and I would like to come to a conclusion based of facts, dates and proof.

I gently asked her that I was willing to settle the debt with not the full amount ( {$1600.00} ) but with what I have - which was {$1100.00}.

This time a lady named Ms. XXXX answered and asked me to hold and before I could reply, put me on hold once again for another 7 minutes after which I hung up. I called again and I asked the lady why they were putting me on indefinite hold and she put me through. I finally got through to XXXX XXXX and I explained to her the abuse I'd recieved earlier. She said that she trains all her employees not to be abusive which was not true at all. I asked her if she'd be able to offer me a settlement and she too rudely stated that she wouldn't and proceeded to read out the consequences. I asked her if my inability to pay would show on my credit report and Ms. XXXX STATED CLEARLY THAT THIS DEBT WOULD SHOW UP ON MY CREDIT REPORT. When I said that I'd checked all my credit reports ( XXXX, XXXX  & XXXX XXXX ) she reiterated that I was wrong that it indeed would show up on my credit report.

All other information is incorrect. There is also no driver 's license identification attached with the application. I called Procollect and was told I needed to submit a police report also to confirm identify theft. I emailed the police report on XX/XX/19. On XX/XX/19, the debt was reported to my credit report even after I told them it was not my debt and it was identity theft in writing. I have since spoken to ProCollect several times ( XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) and they say it my debt only because the social security numbers match and the thieves are using an old driver 's license number that is no longer valid, in use, and is from another state. I am a victim of several online breaches including XXXX  breach and my social security number could have been stolen then.

About 2 weeks later I received an eviction notice through the mail at my new residence which I found very odd. When I arrived at court house on the court date, the clerk informed me that XXXX XXXX had dropped the case because they received the keys a week earlier. This also struck me as odd because I left the keys in the drop box in an envelope with my name and unit number on the front as I was instructed. Fast forward a few months later and Pro Collect is sending me a bill for {$1800.00}. When I disputed the account they sent over copies of the eviction notice and other documents to validate the account. The date the eviction was served the apartment had been vacated for 2 weeks. The letter also stated that I moved out without proper notice. So according to XXXX XXXX I moved out and was evicted simultaneously! But I gave them both verbal & written notice. <P/>After explaining the various issues I had with the property, ( including not removing the person who broke into my apartment because he was not on any lease, and the XXXX / eggs that were thrown on my vehicle on multiple occasions, and the XXXX that was rubbed all over the bathroom walls at the pool ), the manager on site became very agitated and told me that it was not part of her job description to handle those things. <P/>Three weeks later I noticed that my rent payment had not cleared so I called the front office and I was told that the check had bounced due to insufficient funds and I would have to pay a {$50.00} return check fee ( there is a sign in the office that says the return check fee is {$35.00} ). When I called my bank they assured me that the check had never even been processed. They also advised me not to pay the return check fee until I got the check back. <P/>I then made a phone call to XXXX XXXX and spoke to a guy named XXXX who told me he would resolve the matter. Minutes later he called back and told me he spoke with the manager on site and that my check was ready. When I went to the front office the manager told me the check was not there, that it would come through the mail. After arguing with her for 5 minutes or so, she opens a drawer and pulls my check out. The manager on site lied straight to my face and showed her true character. I returned to the bank and got a cashiers check and paid they rent that way so there was no more confusion. <P/>I was completely moved out of the apartment on XXXX XXXX, 2014 and have documentation to prove this. I was instructed to leave the apartment key in an envelope with my name and apartment number in the drop box which I did. Weeks later I received an eviction notice in the mail. When I went to the court house on the court date, the clerk told me that XXXX dropped the case. This was done deliberately to make it look like I was evicted instead of moving out. Since living at XXXX XXXX I have had to deal with shady managers that make up their own rules. When I moved into the apartment I was told the security deposit was {$250.00}. Shortly after moving in I received a notice from the then manager XXXX, that I owed an additional {$100.00} because the deposit was {$350.00} and not {$250.00}. I called XXXX XXXX and they confirmed that the deposit was {$250.00} so apparently the manager XXXX was scheming an extra {$100.00} off new tenants. <P/>So I was told the security deposit was {$350.00} instead of {$250.00}, then the return check fee was {$50.00} instead of {$35.00}, on top of being told that my check bounced when it was never even processed.

If Pro Collect doesn't clear this up immediately with the credit bureaus, we will lose our chance at buying this home. \n\nPlease help us. \n\nThank you.", "submitted_via": "Web", "issue": "Took or threatened to take negative or legal action", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "zip_code": "914XX"}, "_index": "complaint-public-v2"},{"_score": 0.0, "_type": "complaint", "_id": "2594164", "_source": {"company_public_response": null, "timely": "Yes", "product": "Debt collection", "sub_issue": "Didn't receive enough information to verify debt", "tags": null, "sub_product": "I do not know", "company": "ProCollect, Inc", "date_sent_to_company": "2017-08-03T12:00:00-05:00", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "date_received": "2017-08-03T12:00:00-05:00", "complaint_id": "2594164", "state": "TX", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent not provided", "complaint_what_happened": null, "submitted_via": "Web", "issue": "Written notification about debt", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "zip_code": "75115"}, "_index": "complaint-public-v2"},{"_score": 0.0, "_type": "complaint", "_id": "2350620", "_source": {"company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "timely": "Yes", "product": "Debt collection", "sub_issue": "Debt is not mine", "tags": "Servicemember", "sub_product": "Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)", "company": "ProCollect, Inc", "date_sent_to_company": "2017-02-17T12:00:00-05:00", "consumer_disputed": "Yes", "date_received": "2017-02-17T12:00:00-05:00", "complaint_id": "2350620", "state": "OH", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "complaint_what_happened": "I was enlisted in the XXXX in XXXX, someone put my name on an apartment lease in XXXX.

I was informed by the office staff member that the manager XXXX was unavailable at the moment. I told them that I would call back. I decided to go to the XXXX  and speak with XXXX instead of calling back. Once there, I asked XXXX if there was some way that we could work out a settlement for the {$1400.00} that was owed to the XXXX  from XX/XX/XXXX. She stated the collection company ProCollect - has the account and if I work out a settlement with them to let her know. She gave me a number to contact them on XXXX. At XXXX I called and spoke with a young lady who claimed to be an account manager. She stated that they already sent me a settlement letter on XX/XX/XXXX for {$730.00}. I stated that is incorrect, I have never received a letter and I would have most certainly paid a 50 % off settlement. She claims they did. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she puts me on hold. She them comes back to the line and says her manager said no settlements, no payments. I again, asked to speak to the manager and this girl said that they were too busy to talk to me. I asked for the supervisors name and she said it did not matter because they were all going to tell me the same thing. She was putting me down as a refusal to pay and that the balance was due in 2 days. I asked what will happen to me if I dont pay it she said its due in 2 days. We hung up and I called the owners of the XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX and spoke with XXXX. She said that the general manager would call me back and see if there was something that could be done. I advised her that would be great. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I called XXXX XXXX because I had not heard from the general manager yet. Again, I spoke with XXXX and she said she would find out what happened and call me back. At XXXX am XXXX called me back to let me know the general manager was in a conference and would call me back on Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). At XXXX on the same day the XXXX  property manager, XXXX, called me and we discussed the issue. She said she would call Procollect and work out a settlement with them ; we spoke for 3 minutes. At XXXX, XXXX called me and said before she calls them she wanted to know what settlement I was able to pay. I told her I had planned for {$820.00} ( my paycheck ) but since ProCollect offered the settlement in XX/XX/XXXX for {$730.00}, I could definitely pay that ASAP. XXXX said, ok, between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX dollars?. I said yes maam. We spoke for 1 minute. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I called XXXX at the XXXX to ask her if there was a settlement reached. She said the collection agency will call you and hung up. At XXXX I called ProCollect at XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX. She said there was a settlement that she just got emailed to her for {$1000.00}. She then asked me if I had received the settlement letter yet. I stated that I had not and that amount did not sound right. She gets loud and rude with me. I tell her that I will have to speak to someone else and hang up. At XXXX I called proCollect at XXXX and spoke to XXXX XXXX an account collections manager. She stated that she did see the settlement and she gave me all of the information that I needed to mail a money order in. I advised her that this settlement did not sound right as thats not what we ( XXXX and myself ) discussed. She said she will try to reach out to them and put me on hold. She comes back to the line and says that she can not get them but that she would work on it the rest of the day and Monday XX/XX/XXXX. She gave me her extention and I asked if she would be the one to call me before XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX because everyone I had spoken with was extrememly rude. She said yes. She will call me back on Monday. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from a Procollect collections agent at XXXX advising me that the settlement was for {$1000.00}. I advised them that I was waiting for XXXX XXXX to call me back as she is working on the account. I hung up. I called the XXXX at XXXX and was advised that XXXX was busy. I then called XXXX XXXX at XXXX and left a message with XXXX to please have the general manager to call me back. At XXXX, XXXX from the XXXX called and said that corporate decided the settlement not her. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX I called ProCollect at XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX. For 9 minutes he refused to let me speak to XXXX XXXX, demanded my debit card information, and repeatedly put me on hold. He claimed that the XXXX  had no control over what I pay because the account is in HIS office. He said that I couldnt speak to XXXX XXXX because the account is updated and anyone can help me I didnt need to speak to her. I asked him what day the settlement letter was mailed out for this settlement ( since I was told previously that there was one ) and he said they dont send out letters. He would not give me any information without screaming it at me. He stated that I could send a money order in by regular mail but if it wasnt there by XX/XX/XXXX that the whole balance would be due. I obtained the mailing address and my account number. He hung up on me. At XXXX I contacted XXXX at the XXXX extremely upset and crying. I advised her what XXXX XXXX said and she told me that he was spouting nonsense. It took her a minute to get me to calm down as XXXX XXXX upset me severely by the way he was speaking to me. She told me to send the money order the way I had planned regular mail, certified. She told me to keep a check on the money order and when they cash it to check the balance there. If it was a balance left that they were trying to charge me, to let her know and she would take care of it from there. At XXXX, I called ProCollect back to update them on what XXXX had said to me and was once again speaking to XXXX XXXX. Again, he screamed at me and was obnoxiously rude. He was very loud and aggressive towards me. He demanded that I send the payment overnight or through XXXX XXXX. He again said that the full balance would be due after XX/XX/XXXX. I advised him that I was going to do what XXXX told me to do. He continued to put me on hold and when he would come back to the phone he would be loud and aggressively rude again. I verified the account number and address again and told him that I was very glad the calls were recorded and I hung up. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I called ProCollect and again, I was transferred to XXXX XXXX. He advised me that since I did not pay the settlement by XX/XX/XXXX that the full balance ( {$1400.00} ) was due. He then demanded my debit card information and stated that I could pay through XXXX XXXX. I advised him that I was calling in to let them know that I was mailing the {$1000.00} money order today. I asked him to verify the account number and address again. He refused. I asked several times and he wouldnt verify until I started speaking the account number. I asked him if they would send me a receipt do I need to include a self addressed stamped envelope? He said they do not accept any mail and that he would mail my money order back to me. I told him to have a great day and I hung up. At XXXX I called the XXXX and left a message for XXXX that I mailed the {$1000.00} settlement money order to ProCollect by certified mail. I also asked the office staff to please let her know that XXXX XXXX said he was going to mail my money order back to me if it was not the full amount.

Debt collection, about the move-out charge for bed 2. I solved the issues with the rental company before already, but they keep letting debt collector contact me for the money, and now they denied we solved the issue before. \n\n3. Dear CFPB : Thank you so much for taking the time to read all those and helping me. \nTwo years ago, I lived in XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX, XXXX XXXX- three bedrooms house. During the staying, I switched houses in between, so I lived in two furnished houses with this company for around two years and never had any late, missing payment or damage ever. \nWhen I ended the final lease with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, after I graduate. 5 days later, my sublease started to enter the house on XXXX XXXX ( my roommate left the door open for them to enter no matte when they officially move in ). They removed the bed from the room to the living room because they have their own bed ( I revisit the house on XXXX and lived in my friends room XXXX for one night, so I saw with my own eyes, the bed was good downstairs ). \nMy room was supposed to be inspected before the sublease move in. When new people move in, new people and company will do inspection together as well. I did not receive any notifications about any damage charges after I moved out and before the sublease moved in. So I assumed there were no damages. But around one to two weeks after the sublease moved in, I received an email from the office, saying there was a {$120.00} damage charge on the bed with photo token sent after sublease moved in for weeks already. If the damage was caused by me, they could find out during inspections and send to me during the inspection period. But the damage was reported to me after other people moved in already and after all the previous inspection period past. Therefore, I called the office about it, the office said it didnt make sense, not to worry, they will take care. So I didnt worry, trusted them, didnt ask any emails to confirm and let it go. \nAround XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( dont remember when ) I keep getting debt collectors phone calls to ask me for this money ( at this time its not on my credit record ). I was shocked. So I called the office again for the situation and the collector issues, the girl who picked up my phone put me on hold talking to the higher manager, and then tell me not to worry again, they will contact the debt collector about it, might take some time but they will handle it. I should remember her name and ask her to send me a confirmation email but I didnt. XXXX me This XXXX I saw my FICO score started to drop for the reason of the presence of derogatory public collection. I thought they need some time for FICO to take it down and my father past away so I was busy handling my family and myself, didnt keep tracking the progress. But now the note is still there, so I feel there is something wrong. I called XXXX XXXX again today, this time was different girl picked up my phone, denied I solved the issue with them before, asked me for writings from office to prove and saying I have to deal with the debt collector, once they hand the case to collector, it is out of their hand and refuse to discuss the damage issues with me. \nI have XXXX credit cards for years with perfect records, my highest FICO score was above 800 for months. Rented a few apartments, never late or miss any payment. If I should pay, I will never refuse to pay. If it was not them told me I don't need to worry, I won't let any payment be this late to show on my credit record. I paid everything for my life for the amount much greater than this {$120.00}. I have no reasons to delay any payment for two years I am always XXXX student in school, been on XXXXXXXX XXXX for the entire college. I promise with my own life that it was not me causing the damages in the first place, and I didnt mean to delay or avoid any payments. Everything I said above is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Despite my daily life is ruined by hundreds of phone calls from a debt collector, my credit history is ruined because of it. I am so worried that my future will be negative impacted by this because I know how important a perfect credit history is. Its the first time I face such a situation ; I really dont know what to do now. Please help me. \nNo matter what, thank you so much for everything. I sincerely appreciate all your time and helps. \nSincerely yours, 4. XXXX at XXXX XXXX Address:XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX PA XXXX Phone : ( XXXX ) XXXX 5.

The frequency of harassment calls have increased ever since we filed disputes with the credit bureaus and obviously since they are a hired agency, they have no interest in learning about the facts of the case. \n\nThe facts are as follows : a ) TENANT IN COLLEGE STUDENT HOUSING : My daughter was a college student at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX University and rented an apartment with another student at XXXX XXXX, Texas at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I co-signed the lease ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) as a 3rd party guarantor. \n\nb ) The rent was diligently paid on-time by my daughter and the apartment was well kept and fine till XX/XX/XXXX. Even XXXX  XXXX XXXX will testify to that fact. \n\nc ) My daughter 's roommate ( another tenant ) had allowed her brother to illegally stay in the all girl 's apartment from XX/XX/XXXX. He was not a legal renter at apartment and pretty much lived in the apartment which was leased out to the 2 girls only. It was very uncomfortable for my daughter and she repeatedly complained to the roommate and XXXX XXXX XXXX management from XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nd ) NO ACTION TAKEN DESPITE REPEATED COMPLAINTS : XXXX XXXX XXXX local site management did nothing, except saying \" we will look into this ''. The relationship between my daughter and her roommate deteriorated considerably as a result of the repeated complaints. The XXXX XXXX management were repeatedly asked to do something - they did nothing. \n\ne ) ROBBERY & BREAK-IN : On XX/XX/XXXX, my daughter 's bedroom in the apartment was broken into, her laptop, purse and several items were stolen and a male sweatshirt was left on her bed as a warning. A police report was filed, Case # XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Texas and based on police recommendation that there could be a threat to my daughter from bodily harm, my daughter 's mother and I asked her to immediately vacate the apartment promptly. \n\nf ) POLICE RECOMMENDATION : XXXX XXXX XXXX Police Department assigned detective, Detective XXXX, ( I can provide his contact number if needed ) to the case as well. My daughter immediately vacated the apartments, handed the keys to the local XXXX management, informed them of the police report and the break-in. \n\ng ) ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMPANY : The landlord 's behavior was simply shocking - they were more concerned about rent money and lease, irrespective of what happened and their own negligence in evicting the illegal renter from the premises. Even though, the apartment was vacated on XX/XX/XXXX, she paid rent for the full month of XX/XX/XXXX and had to find a place to rent in the midst of the semester. \n\nh ) XXXX XXXX XXXX management kept harassing my daughter with phone calls and emails about breaking her lease violations and insisted that she had to pay for the remaining 2 months rent ( $ XXXX/- total ), even though as landlords they failed to provide a safe, secure environment and despite knowing that it was because of their own inaction this situation had escalated between 2 roommates and an illegal male renter was comfortably occupying the place. \n\ni ) XXXX  XXXX XXXX management started harassing me for the lease violation and threatened to damage my credit as a guarantor. I warned them to keep away from my daughter as she was in the midst of her term exams. The emails and phone calls continued. I asked them to challenge us in a legal court, which they have refused. \n\nj ) They hired a debt collections agency to harass us.

Procollect is trying to collect an incorrect amount on the debt. I had an initial debt of {$450.00}. I agreed and established that the debt was valid and I have been paying on the debt as often as two or three times a month. Procollect is not reporting payments to both credit bureaus. The two bureaus have different information about what I owe, which negatively impacts my rating. I submitted moneyorder receipts and asked all agencies to investigate my evidence and make the corrections. XXXX ( Complaint # XXXX ) and XXXX credit reporting agencies have erroneous amounts owed on my reports. \nI have gotten the debt down to {$220.00}. I check my XXXX XXXX account regularly to insure that my payments are being credited and received. I made the monthly payments without specifying a particular amount to be paid each month ( contract ). I am on a fixed income of only {$850.00} per month right now. I did not want to go into default on the debt, if unable to pay what I had agreed upon. I filed a complaint with XXXX  related to the incorrect balance noted on the report ( Complaint # XXXX ). I made sure to write both XXXX and Procollect and ask them to update my list of payments, using the information and copies of moneyorders. They have refused to do so. XXXX stated that they had investigated and say that I now owe {$260.00}. This is a {$37.00} difference from my calculations. The XXXX report states that I currently owe {$360.00} which is way off the mark. \nI am constantly receiving notifications ( from XXXX XXXX ) that my credit is being damaged because ProCollect is not giving me credit. What my records show I owe and what Procollect is reporting to the credit agencies is NOT correct. I sent Procollect copies of my payment receipts ( which they are  ignoring ). The balances between the two credit bureaus are inaccurate. I have made two efforts to dispute the incorrect information. I made copies of the postal moneyorders I mailed to Procollect plus the dates they were mailed out. Neither Procollect or the credit agencies properly investigated or updated the  information. The only thing I asked them to do was to tell me which payments they HAD received from me ( using the list that I provided ) and to let me know which ones were not credited. Inaccurate information is being kept on my credit record even though I have provided proof that I had made these payments. If I am to pay off the rest of the debt, I EXPECT to be fairly audited and that no more derogatory remarks be placed upon my account UNTIL I receive confirmation and validation for the payments I have made. I do not feel that it is fair for me to have to pay {$5.00} to research missing money orders or to have to certify EVERY single moneyorder that I send by mail. \nThe credit bureaus and Procollect are not accurately reporting or confirming my payments. I need all organizations to update my credit files and to cease the marks until a resolution is made. Thank you!

After reviewing my report, it has a debt in collections that I was NEVER informed about until XXXX which is 2 years as of now. XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a XXXX letter, but received an offered to pay a 50 % in XX/XX/XXXX. After I received the pay 50 % in XXXX, I called to remove because it is invalid and I didnt receive any validation letter. I told the lady in XXXX, I sent a validation letter, she said they sent it but they only sent a pay 50 % letter. She then said I couldnt even accept 50 % offer, I HAVE TO pay the full amount THAT DAY. They are also reporting XX/XX/XXXX the date of the 1st delinquency, WRONG. Tried to let her know that this lease was terminate for safety issues. She said she could no longer help me, I was refusing to pay and hung up. In XXXX, sent another letter for validation ( confirmed received XXXX but I have not received. XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted once again. Spoke to the foulest, impolite, bad mannered XXXX XXXX. Calling to resolve a debt. I tried to explain to XXXX XXXX that the property manager and I, agreed in front of the authorities at the time of departure due to safety and security issues. What did I need to provide because termination was via email after a verbal agreement. I couldnt finish, she interrupted I DONT CARE ABOUT YOU SAFETY OR SECURITY, you can go back to the client but they will refer you right back to us. If its your lease, its yours. Im marking this for refusal to pay & hung up. I tried to call again. Maybe a new rep is polite. I called again. I spoke with callous, impolite XXXX XXXX. I tried to inform her that it was agreed on via email but she stated I had to have a lease showing a zero balance. The authorities were involved and I wanted to ensure what I had on file was enough. All dates per information I have reflect around the same dates. All were involved because of the living condition issues since I moved in, by the time my car was vandalized every water facet had XXXX surfacing and flooding the kitchen and bathroom. XXXX then said oh yeah well HONEY I cant help you, thats a personal problem that I could CARELESS ABOUT, if you cant prove it then you owe the debt and YOUR REFUSING PAYMENT, I no longer have anything to say to you. Why it took two years and a validation letter before I received anything, to be aware. Her answer, I am placing you on hold, your refusing to pay. Please have them submit the calls to prove that complaints are REAL. Once again no help but I called again. XXXX XXXX, I inform him about the rude reps and I just want to know what I needed to provide to them that was sufficient enough. He then stated that he could not help me, demanded a payment in XXXX days, in full {$640.00}. When I sent validation letter in XX/XX/XXXX, I only received a pay 50 % letter in XXXX. He said they sent the validation letter but when? Ive been trying to resolve this for 5 months, NO HELP. The property manager is no longer there but I will try to have them confirm. XXXX XXXX says the same thing as XXXX XXXX \" You can call them but they will send you back to me '' Again, really! How can a company who has NEVER contacted me, and Ive been the one initiating resolving this matter now refuse to just simply consider that the debt may be in error, only will note \" REFUSAL TO PAY '' & intimidate the consumer by telling them you have 3 days to pay OR ELSE! He said wasnt concerned with anything I had, he will only take another signed lease, I sighed the lease and I have to pay PERIOD. If theyre referring the info that we provide to their clients for review, then why cant we? Where is the customer service? I also received an email per Procollect and they recalled the email and I no longer have it. \nIn accordance with Fair Credit Reporting Act Section FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681g I have the right to demand that you disclose to me all of the documents that you have recorded and retained in your file at the time of the request concerning the accounts that you are reporting in my credit report.

All collection added to credit bureaus must be removed. Also during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my attorney to continuing filing suit. This includes any listing of any information to a credit-reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated. If ProCollect fails to respond to this validation request within 5 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately.

After I faxed and email my proof they did nothing to fix the problem I called the XXXX and file a claim with them they told as well that it was going to take care. I contacted Procollect to ask for a letter stating that issue has been taking care and that balance has been removed from credit report, I 'm asking for the letter because I do n't trust them and I 'm scare that this is going to happen again.

This balance is due within 30 days of this notice. Any security deposit disputes will only accepted in writing. '' I was obviously confused at this because I had notified some staff members of my departure both prior to my graduation date, as well as on the exact day I had left and provided them with my key fob, mail key and all other property belonging to the apartment. \n\nSoon after I had received that letter, I started receiving phone calls from random people claiming to be from a collections agency. Then another. And then another. One call after the other, each \" agent '' claiming that if I had not paid my debt in full within 30 days they would put a derogatory mark on my credit ( which had only been established for 5-6 months at the time ). They had even sent a man to visit my mother 's house on 2+ separate occasions in the evening ( around XXXX-XXXX ) in order to physically claim this 'debt. ' As you can already imagine, my mother was terrified. \n\nAfter the phonecalls and the physical visits from people claiming to be agents, I had received another letter on XX/XX/XXXX, from a company called ProCollect Incorporated stating that I owe them a total of {$3300.00} ( which had broken down from the original {$3300.00} + a {$7.00} collection fee ). See the attached photo for copies of both this letter and the one received in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nOnce I had received my first official FICO score I noticed that my score was rated at a XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, and then a score of XXXX in the following month due to a \" derogatory public record or collection filed. '' Throughout the year I had been in the Midwest on a family mission to establish some investments for my mother 's company. Because of this I was unable to properly handle the situation in person ( neither had I known about the CFPB.gov at the time ). I did, however, make attempts to explain my situation to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX via phone call, to which they had explained to me that they had already filed with the collections agency, therefore there was nothing that they can do to help the situation ( this was ironic and discouraging to me, given that they were the ones filing the complaint ). Although I had been advised to NOT make contact with the agency, I had called them anyway to dispute my situation, to which I was prompted to either pay the debt in full or suffer consequences via derogatory remarks on my credit reporting ( this was in XX/XX/XXXX ). \n\nSince then, I have stopped receiving calls and my mother has stopped receiving unwelcomed visits, but I have had this mark on my credit, and I am seeking for it to be removed without it affecting my credit score any longer. \n\nI have never had an issue with this apartment for the entire duration that I lived there. Not ONCE, even when I had XXXX  and briefly XXXX there for my first summer job in XX/XX/XXXX, I did not have any issues with XXXX XXXX. No issues, until this whole situation had occurred last year.", "submitted_via": "Web", "issue": "Took or threatened to take negative or legal action", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "zip_code": "853XX"}, "_index": "complaint-public-v2"},{"_score": 0.0, "_type": "complaint", "_id": "2505803", "_source": {"company_public_response": null, "timely": "Yes", "product": "Debt collection", "sub_issue": "Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged", "tags": "Servicemember", "sub_product": "Other debt", "company": "ProCollect, Inc", "date_sent_to_company": "2017-06-10T12:00:00-05:00", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "date_received": "2017-06-10T12:00:00-05:00", "complaint_id": "2505803", "state": "MO", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "complaint_what_happened": "I received a letter fr om Procollect offering  a settlement and deletion from my credit reports.

While there at ProCollect , Inc I spoke with 3 employees including 2 managers and they still would NOT take my {$99.00} payment for the XXXX 's XXXX XXXX account. Since I could NOT get any cooperation from ProCollect , Inc, I decided to go and visit the original debtor which is XXXX 's XXXX XXXX in which the management took my payment and gave me a receipt that I promptly tried to return to ProCollect, Inc. ProCollect , Inc would NOT take the receipt from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ProCollect , Inc said that I would either have to mail it in or fax it to them. I did both, and after a couple of weeks I realized that the debt was still listed on 1 of the 3 bureaus. Coincidentally ProCollect , Inc called me this same day. ProCollect , Inc informed me that they would NOT remove the {$99.00} debt from credit file with XXXX   until I paid the other 10 year old debt that they had on their books. After threatening to contact your office I was very harshly informed of their lack of concern about me contacting your office. Furthermore, I also mailed and faxed a copy of the XXXX 's XXXX XXXX receipt to XXXX XXXX dispute department. XXXX   informed me that the debt could NOT be removed even though I sent them a receipt of payment, unless ProCollect , Inc says that it is ok to remove it.

I indicated on my application that I had a dog, and I also indicated what type of dog I had. My application was approved to move in. About 3 days later I received a call from the leasing office stating that they made a mistake with my application and the accidentally overlooked the dog. They explained that while pets were accepted my dog was too big and they have breed restrictions. I was asked to send in a copy of my dogs vaccine records, and proof of town registration. I did as requested. A few days later, I was contacted again by the leasing company and they told me if I dont get rid of the dog theyre going to evict me. I explained to them that the pet and her breed was listed on the original application, they approved everything, I shouldnt be subject to an eviction notice because of this. around XX/XX/2017 I received a notice to quit, shortly after on XX/XX/2017 I received an Eviction notice for unpaid rent. I went into housing court and filed a response to the eviction. I explained that I have always paid my property rent, and the unpaid rent they are attempting to take me to court for are unpaid PET RENT and a security deposit for the dog. The case went through mediation, the lawyer representing my apartment was present. I presented all of my rent receipts since occupying the premises. We attempted to come to an agreement, I asked for a lease for my dog before paying them the pet fees that I was recently made aware of. The leasing company refused to give me a pet lease. No agreement was made at the mediation process on or about XX/XX/2017. After returning to my residence the leasing company called the police and told them that my dog was violent and people felt threatened for their safety. The police officer explained to me that the leasing company was requesting for my dog to be removed from the premises. The police officer took a look at my dog, and his behavior, and he said he doesnt see a reason to remove the dog. The dog had a good temperament and is not causing a problem. After that incident I no longer felt comfortable in my apartment. I vacated the property on the weekend of XX/XX/2017. The keys were returned to XXXX in the leasing office. The apartment was left the same way that I received it. No damages were done to the property, and it was clean spotless when I moved out. I went back to court on XX/XX/17 to finish up the eviction process. The lawyer for the leasing company did not show up. The judge advised me that the case had been withdrawn without costs to any party. No judgement was ever placed against me. I was never evicted. My rent was always paid. Months later I check my credit report and a collection agency PROCOLLECT is charging me over {$3500.00} in falsified fees from the same apartment company. This is not my debt. I never received any notice of this item being placed on my credit report. I do not owe Procollect or XXXX any money. This case has been involved in litigation. The credit bureau XXXX has already removed this false debt from my credit report. PROCOLLECT needs to stop falsely reporting inaccurate information to XXXX  and XXXX. Take a look at the court documents that will be attached to this complaint, I do not owe any money. Procollect is ruining my credit score and degrading my character.

When they did n't pass inspection the state does n't pay their portion of the rent. It also stated that I was not responsible for the states portion of the rent payment. XXXX XXXX received this notice. XXXX XXXX finally fixed the issue. XXXX XXXX attempted to collect the payment that Housing was responsible for from me.

I advised her I would stay until we settled in court. On our court date XXXX XXXX could not prove that I owed the money they were trying to collect from me.

He hung up with my husband and then contacted my cell phone several times. \nI contacted the property we formally resided at to inquire about charges we owed I spoke to XXXX she said that she was an assistant manager. She said the apartment complex was under new management, so it would be difficult to answer any questions regarding the collection call we received. She was able to locate some records that noted that we owed money after we moved out. I informed her that everything was paid before we moved out in XXXX and if we owed any money why did n't we ever receive a phone call or letter. She said that we may not have received notification if we broke the lease and vacated the property prior end of lease. I told her that we did not. I contacted Pro Collect to inquire about the bill and told by a young lady that if I had a dispute she could not assist me she could only take a payment. \nWe paid our final bill prior to moving out and spoke directly to a manager and office clerk that informed us that we did not owe anything. If they noticed later that charges were not calculated correctly and money was due, it was management responsibility to ensure that we received notice of what was owed.

XXXX XXXX corresponded that he had had mail forwarding through the US Post Office ( see pdf XXXX USPS Change of Address Confirmation and XXXXUSPS Mail Hold ) to his new address and never received any correspondence from XXXX XXXX XXXX  about any outstanding debt owed. The Supervisor stated that the XXXX was allegedly mailed to XXXX XXXX at his old address, but she was unable to provide proof of returned mail nor explain why it was never forwarded to XXXX XXXX or sent to him at his email address like previous correspondence from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Supervisor stated that verification of the Debt would be mailed by ProCollect to XXXX XXXX via US Mail. The Supervisor stated that the alleged debt was reported as delinquent on XXXX XXXX credit report by ProCollect. During both telephone calls, XXXX XXXX stated that he wanted all correspondence regarding this matter to be sent to him via email or US. Mail and not via telephone. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX ( EST ), XXXX XXXX received another automated call from XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX emailed ProCollect indicating again his 2nd request that ProCollect not contact him on his telephone number but rather only via email or US Mail ( see pdfs XXXX XXXX - ProCollect ( 2nd Warning re_ Telephone Calls ) and XXXX XXXX - Re_ ProCollect ( 2nd Warning re_ Telephone Calls ) Amended ) On XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX ( EST ), XXXX XXXX received a letter from ProCollect ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) ( see pdf XXXXProCollect Letter ) alleging that he had an outstanding debt with Lease Term Insurance Group in the amount of {$91.00} and that ProCollect had been referred the account by the original creditor and that XXXX XXXX had 30 days from the date he receives the letter to dispute its validity. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX sent a letter to ProCollect via email and US mail ( see pdf XXXXProCollect Letter ) disputing the validity of this reported debt and request that ProCollect send me verification of the debt. XXXX XXXX also stated again that he requested all correspondence regarding this matter be sent to him only via email or US. Mail. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX ( EST ), XXXX XXXX received a letter packet from ProCollect ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) ( see pdf XXXX ProCollect Debt Letter ) indicating that our client contends this is a true and valid debt and the attached is the information you requested. On page 7 of the packet, in a very difficult to read discolored page, it states that XXXX XXXX owed {$41.00} for Final Bill and {$50.00} for Cleaning Fees. It is also hand written on the page that on XX/XX/XXXX mailed to address here never forwarded. The remainder of the pages contained unrelated apartment lease documents which did not pertain to the alleged debt. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX submitted yet another dispute letter packet indicating that the information sent by ProCollect does NOT contain any information as the details of this reported debt. The only reference to this reported balance due of {$91.00} is on one page ( very poor quality see attachment ) of the numerous irrelevant documents sent and it merely states that there is a {$50.00} charge for cleaning fees and a {$41.00} charge for final bill. On the line above these charges, it is difficult to read but I believe it states, trash left in garage, clean toilet, bathtub, floors and kitchen pics attached. On this same document, it is handwritten that mailed to address here, never forwarded. XXXX XXXX further details I dispute that any bill was sent to me as I had a mail hold and forwarding to my new address from XX/XX/XXXX onwards ( see attachments ). I received numerous pieces of forwarded mail during the Fall of XX/XX/XXXX at my current address in Indiana but never received anything from XXXX XXXX. It is likely that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not actually mail any Invoice/Bill to me. Ironically, XXXX XXXX and I communicated periodically via email during my XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX leasing term but I never received any email regarding this matter. XXXX XXXX also had my telephone number, but I never received any calls or voicemails from them. The first that I heard of this reported bill is during my telephone conversation with ProCollect on XX/XX/XXXX. \nI am writing again to request the detailed bills for the cleaning fees and final bill. I dispute that these are valid bills for me as I never received them and still have not received details about what the bills are for. Regarding the reported cleaning fees, I took time stamped pictures of the apartment prior to moving out which proves that the apartment was in the same condition as move in. Regarding the trash that was left in the garage ; a representative from XXXX XXXX stated that the item would be taken to the local XXXX ( see attached email ). I look forward to receiving communication from ProCollect either 1 )  validating that this reported bill is frivolous and invalid or 2 ) the actual original invoice/bill for the final bill and cleaning fees that detail the charges assessed to me and the reasons they were assessed. The information sent by ProCollect on XX/XX/XXXX does not provide validation of the reported bill. \n\nAs of the date of this CFPB complaint [ XX/XX/XXXX ], XXXX XXXX has never received any further correspondence from ProCollect but has continued to falsely report derogatory remarks on XXXX XXXX credit history ( see pdf XXXX ProCollect on XXXX XXXX )", "submitted_via": "Web", "issue": "Written notification about debt", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "zip_code": null}, "_index": "complaint-public-v2"},{"_score": 0.0, "_type": "complaint", "_id": "1526234", "_source": {"company_public_response": "Company chooses not to provide a public response", "timely": "Yes", "product": "Debt collection", "sub_issue": "Not given enough info to verify debt", "tags": "Older American, Servicemember", "sub_product": "Medical", "company": "ProCollect, Inc", "date_sent_to_company": "2015-08-19T12:00:00-05:00", "consumer_disputed": "No", "date_received": "2015-08-19T12:00:00-05:00", "complaint_id": "1526234", "state": "TX", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent not provided", "complaint_what_happened": null, "submitted_via": "Web", "issue": "Disclosure verification of debt", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "zip_code": "77346"}, "_index": "complaint-public-v2"},{"_score": 0.0, "_type": "complaint", "_id": "2796099", "_source": {"company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "timely": "Yes", "product": "Debt collection", "sub_issue": "Talked to a third-party about your debt", "tags": null, "sub_product": "Other debt", "company": "ProCollect, Inc", "date_sent_to_company": "2018-01-28T12:00:00-05:00", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "date_received": "2018-01-28T12:00:00-05:00", "complaint_id": "2796099", "state": "TX", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent not provided", "complaint_what_happened": null, "submitted_via": "Web", "issue": "Threatened to contact someone or share information improperly", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "zip_code": "78249"}, "_index": "complaint-public-v2"},{"_score": 0.0, "_type": "complaint", "_id": "2781522", "_source": {"company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "timely": "Yes", "product": "Debt collection", "sub_issue": "Debt is not yours", "tags": null, "sub_product": "Other debt", "company": "ProCollect, Inc", "date_sent_to_company": "2018-01-14T12:00:00-05:00", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "date_received": "2018-01-14T12:00:00-05:00", "complaint_id": "2781522", "state": "GA", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "complaint_what_happened": "TO : XXXX XXXX & CEO/President XXXX XXXX Pro Collect/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX Cc : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

XXXX XXXX XXXX MD XXXX FROM : XXXX XXXX EMAIL : XXXX REF : Frivolous and Criminal Lawsuit DATE : XX/XX/XXXX Sir/Madam As a child of XXXX, as a young Veteran, as a XXXX XXXX Family Member, I must tell you your company received the wrong complaint. This is the complaint you all should have received. My uncle assisted me in this illegitimate, and unlawful collection predicament. He sent the complaint to the wrong company when it justly belongs to your unprofessional company. \nMy uncle got involved when he found out Pro Collection Inc. employee made an ethnically  prejudiced assertion to me when I called your business. Just like you are sending me paperwork vis -- vis my lease. I am sending you a copy of my lease I signed with another apartment complex when I left XXXX. \nThese two leases crossed each other after I gave XXXX my thirty days notice on the XX/XX/XXXX. I moved out two-week early. I even gave XXXX a copy of my new lease where I presently reside. Before you make shiftless extortions about a situation you scarcely know about, I can only educate you to be cautious. You agreed with XXXX on a lie without examining the facts maam, knowing those past employees are long gone. \nIt seems to me, Pro Collect Inc. and XXXX need a human behavior course, and some racially  sensitive training to comprehend mere mortals intelligently, and temperament. Since you do not have evidence to support your falsehood. I will help you out. First, my work schedule would not permit me to move during business hours. I asked XXXX XXXX XXXX what should I do with the keys after hours. She instructed me where to put them, and I put them exactly where I was told. \nI left a message that night on the voicemail letting her know I did exactly what she instructed me to do. She never returned my call. I thought everything was fine. When I finally heard something about this incidence, I got a letter from Municipal Court that was forwarded to my new address. By that time, the court date, and the appeal process had passed. \nThis begs more questions than answers. I called XXXX again to let her know that I have been gone from there for a while. She stated, they couldnt locate the key. I refreshed her memory regarding our conversation. She told me to hold on. When she came back to the phone after ten minutes or so, she said she found the keys and apologized. I asked her about the court situation. \nShe told me not to worry and she would take care of it. I should have worried after looking back in regretful reflection. I got sued for {$2000.00} in court for KEYS I returned. I dont owe any money to XXXX. Why would I stay there when I had moved into another apartment complex? The XXXX of you maam to labor me as such, and corrupted my credit file where I can not get my V.A. loan. \nEvidently, this is an illegal sham with malicious forethought, or XXXX has some very bad bookkeeping problems. Either one leads me to believe that your collection company and XXXX are practicing a sense of criminality mixed with malevolent and foul intentions. However, these are the trickery and the foolery a leasing office plays with tenants. \nEspecially, when they have the backing of a ruthless collection company that has frightening intentions to degrade and besmirched an innocent Veteran/XXXX XXXX Family Member under the faade of fair collection practices. \nMaam, you are more than uninformed, you are twisting the law as it stands. This makes you extremely dangerous! The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) governs the behavior of debt collectors and debt collection agencies. It places limits on what you can do, or can not do in collecting a no owe debt from me. Unfortunately, despite the law, Pro Collect Inc. are still engrossed in these illegal collection tactics. \nI called your business, I carefully explained the whole situation to your employee, and she said, you people never do right. You people? This phrase has long been used as an interpersonal generalization toward one culture. It has become known as a XXXX sobriquet that targeted XXXX-Americans only. \nThis racism has manifested itself in terms of individual behavior at Pro Collect Inc., and XXXX XXXX XXXX through hate with institutional behavior. This racism is propagated and publicized under the expert tutelage of XXXX XXXX & CEO XXXX XXXX, the overseers at Pro Collect Inc. This is a classic move of evil. However, one characteristic of evil, it contains a seed of its own destruction. \nI decided to bring this tragedy of injustice up this week for a reason. This week we are celebrating XXXX XXXX XXXX birthday, and this is coinciding with the boycott my uncle is planning against XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Georgia. Furthermore, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. \nI thank XXXX and give Him the praises by allowing my uncle to be a lifelong member, and a vice-president of the XXXX I am letting you know XXXX XXXX & CEO XXXX XXXX. We have reached out to XXXX XXXX with XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We will live stream the boycott through XXXX, and XXXX. I will let the world know Pro Collect Inc. had two years to right this wrong, or square this circle, and you stubbornly didnt, and you stubbornly wont. \nI will leave you with a quote from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity ( XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ).

It just started to affect my credit report. Last month I started to receive constant calls from this collection agency about a debt that was owed to XXXX in XXXX XXXX, MI, which I rented on XX/XX/XXXX. I moved out 2 years later, and signed off without any problem or fee due. I lived in XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX for 2 years after my rent with XXXX XXXX ended. After signing off with the leasing office in XXXX, I received no mail, no email, no phone call or any sort of communication at all until Last month I Received calls directly from the collection company regarding a debt of {$610.00} about wall repaint, refrigerator replacement, etc, which I had no knowledge of for over 2 years. I only have the contract from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX in hand. But on the contract it clearly stated that \" Landlord may use, apply, or retain the whole or any part of this Security Deposit to the extent required for the payment of any rent, additional rent or any other sums as to which the Tenant is in default including, but not limited to, any damage beyond ordinary wear and tear to the Premises, including the common areas, or its fixtures or appliances ''. And if any fee was occurred I should have been notified immediately since my contact information and other legal documents are on record. But leasing office did not inform me on anything, and we signed off on the day we moved out with no payments no residual security deposit owed to the apartment. In addition, I called the leasing office of XXXX XXXX, they refused to talk to me since they passed this case to the collection agency already. Then I called the collection agency about my case, and I tried to communicate with the representative : XXXX ( code:XXXX ), but he was rude and treated me with little respect and an attitude that he specifically told me multiple times repeatedly to \" just pay your bills ok? ' I was surprised and shocked by his behavior when I was trying to understand him. He had no patience in listening to my explanation, and he refused to talk to me by keep saying \" have a nice day '' and wanted to hang up as I was trying to understand what he was saying. I know my XXXX was not proficient enough to understand everyone word he said so quickly, so I asked if my boyfriend could try to talk to him and understand the subject. XXXX then specifically told me \" no '', I asked him to send an email to me then, he also refused to do that instead he asked to him and understand the subject. XXXX then specifically with my boyfriend, he is selling his house on the market, I do not want to receive any paper letters from them that would bring damages to my boyfriend 's house sale or reputation. So I asked him over and over why he could n't send an email exaplaining this issue. He refused to give me a reason. I also asked him to send over evidence and bills from the apartment, he refused again by saying he can only send mails. He has no proof nor evidence to identify those damages to the rental apartment came from me or my roommate, for all we know, this could be anyone that later rented the apartment or the apartment 's own damage since my roommate and I specifically had nothing owed or billed and there was no problem when we signed off with the leasing office. This company 's conduct was unprofessional and inappropriate. The leasing office or the collection agency did not contact me for damages for over 2 years.

ProCollect ended up sending me a document, only one that was provided by the apartment complex with the XXXX logo on it. All documents must be presented when requesting validation of debt. There are several things that concern me about the document ( s ) : 1. This is not my signature. This is not my handwriting. This is hardly even my information other than my personal info. I can definitively prove this. 2. XXXX XXXX XXXX, the actual lease holder is a career criminal that already has a record of fraudulent activity. 3. My great grandmother is also listed on the lease as another occupant. My great grandmother has been sick with XXXX and I can guarantee you her information was also illegally obtained. So this is two fraudulent criminal complaints. 4. What scares me is that XXXX XXXX is a career criminal and if she would of requested validation of debt, then she would NOW AGAIN have my social security number. Going forward, I would appreciate that you would white out my Social Security Number and my great grandmother 's SS #. This is simple Credit Law. Consumer Credit Collectors CAN NOT SHARE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS with other consumers, regardless of the situation. 5. I have sent XXXX XXXX several emails, along with his associate XXXX XXXX to resolve this since and they refuse to answer me on how to proceed. I am fed up and if I would of seen the supporting documents back in XXXX 2016, I would of had this taken care of by know.

I have already made XXXX XXXX aware of this matter. If I do n't receive a response by the end of business on Friday XX/XX/XXXX, then I will be retaining XXXX XXXX and we will be going to court.

That caused  XXXX   XXXX  some issues when trying to explain why she accepted my dog because of his breed. So at this point she was trying to cover herself and upset with me because I filed a report. The letter from collections stated I owe monies for damages to the apartment. I asked for proof of damages, pictures a signed copy of the move in and /move out walkthrough that they never showed up to complete upon either. I also again was never contacted by them in an attempt to collect any monies even though they had my address and phone number. They also did not list the  XXXX  pet deposit with my  XXXX  security deposit I paid. On the invoice I received from collections it wasnt listed as being deducted from the alleged damages.

I have been disputing this with ProCollect and the credit agencies for years with no progress. Not only is the debt not mine, but it is also duplicated on my credit reports. I have submitted documents of proof of residency during this time, but ProCollect still will not have the items removed from my credit report and continue to make attempts to collect the debt. I recently contacted ProCollect, the orginal creditor and the credit bureau to provide me with a validation of the debt in the form of the original lease, cancelled checks for rent and/or money order receipts to show proof that I lived there, which none are able to provide. I don't know if this was identity theft or something that the collection agency just came up with. I have had no other problems with any other companies reporting any type of debt during this time. And since no one can provide me with documents to validate the debt, I have to assume that ProCollect has simply put this on my credit report in error, or deliberately. Although ProCollect has stated over the phone that the accounts appear to be duplicates, they will not even remove one of them, which will at least decrease my debt balance. However, both of these accounts need to be removed! They are not my accounts. ProCollect finally said today that they would possibly remove the duplicate account but I would still be responsible for the other account. They said that I needed to provide them with an identity theft affidavit, in order for them to even consider looking into the other account. However, without them providing me any documentation of the lease or payments to verify that someone else used my information ; I don't feel right swearing to identity theft, when I don't know if that is the case. I do not know how they got my information and I can and have provided proof of my residency elsewhere to the credit bureaus. I do not feel comfortable giving ProCollect any more information than they already have about me, since I don't know how they got my information.

I contacted them to try make a payment plans, but they do NOT take payments in increments. The representative I spoke to wanted the money upfront aggressively and was extremely confrontational, then she offered me a settlement of nearly 50 % of what was owed on the two accounts. I told her I couldn't make the payments that day, I was just calling to get more information on theses accounts, but could make them in the next two weeks. She declared, \" I'll just have to put refusal to pay. '' Confused and at this point, nearly having an anxiety attack, I told her I could make the payments as soon as I could with noting, I needed both account numbers. 3 DAYS later, on XX/XX/XXXX, the same exact representative leaving a voicemail on a Saturday stating I \" needed '' to return her call. Confused again, I reached out and told every Procollect representative when speaking to a rep 3 days prior, I thought we had an understanding that I was going to pay in a few weeks. I ended up speaking to the same representative that spoke to XX/XX/XXXX and the conversation didn't go anywhere. When I told her they were breaking the law, she stated, \" I'll just put refusal to pay today on your account and now you'll have to owe all of it instead of 50 % '' rudely with hanging up in my face. After the call, I had an anxiety attack, but definitely sought legal advice. We looked into Procollect 's track history of collections with horrible low rating reviews and according to several consumers they do NOT report to the bureaus when people do pay breaking federal laws extremely. Knowing this information, I contacted Procollect XX/XX/XXXX again asking for a different representative, but noticed the pressure to collect and was told I could use XXXX XXXX to send the payments to them. When putting the account number on their website, you don't see what you owe or or ANY statements. We held off on the payments, but contacted the original rental property to validate the debt and property manager told me there was no record of any debt. Procollect Inc should NOT be in business. If there is a debt legitimately, I don't mind paying, but to handle business one must know how and that's for sure. Aggressively harassing consumers and can't validate debt isn't one of them. As far as I know Procollect has put intentionally debt on people 's credit ( including mine ) that isn't validated. The reviews also report the company doesn't even send letters to verify payments. Speaking with my bank personally, they highly advised to never send XXXX XXXX and if I needed to make a payment make sure a receipt is given because with XXXX XXXX, once the money is sent off, it's gone.
